<h1>Shipping Information</h1>


<p>
We use professional wine shippers for packaging.  Our containers come in four different sizes:
<div class="bld">1 bottle - 3 bottles  –  up to 6 bottles  –  up to 12 bottles</div>
</p>
<p>
Due to recent UPS rate increases, we are raising our 1 bottle and 3 bottles shipping charges. We kindly request that you order a minimum of 3 bottles to make shipping more economical. 
</p>
<p>
Prices &amp; times for UPS Ground depend on the distance from the San Francisco Bay Area.
<br /> If you have other requirements, please <b>contact our Customer Service</b> at webshop @ bluedanubewine.com or +1 (650) 941-4699.
