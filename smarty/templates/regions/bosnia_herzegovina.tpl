<h2 class="region_subheader">Wines &amp; Regions</h2>
Bosnia and Herzegovina has two main wine producing regions: Northern Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The primary varietals of Herzegovina are the red, <a href="/wines/blatina/">Blatina</a> and white, <a href="/wines/zilavka/">Å½ilavka</a>.  There are other, smaller varietals such as the red, <a href="/wines/vranac/">Vranac</a>, which is grown much more in neighboring <a href="/regions/montenegro/">Montenegro</a>, but these two are by far and away the most common and well-crafted wines of the region.
