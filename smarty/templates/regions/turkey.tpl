<h2 class="region_subheader">Reviving Turkey's Wine Heritage</h2>
<p>
Wiyana was the word for wine used by the ancient pre-Hittites who lived in Anatolia between 3,000 and 4,000 BCE. Yet, Turkey, through no fault of its terroir or native grapes, has gone unrecognized as a wine-producing nation for centuries. But the 21st century ushered in welcome changes for this historic homeland of wild vitis vinifera.

In 2001, the state abolished its monopoly on alcohol and the wine industry was privatized and regulated. Although Turkey's fledgling domestic market remains suppressed by punitive taxes, wine quality has soared drawing the attention of industry opinion leaders and wine enthusiasts from eager export markets around the world. As Turkey seeks a global market for its wines, wine importers such as <a href="http://meritaj.com/" target="_blank">Meritaj</a>, will play an important role in the renaissance of Turkey's wine culture.
</p>
<p>Today, Turkey is the top fourth producer of grapes for wine making, by area planted (812,000 hectares = 2 million acres) and the top six producer of grapes with 4.2 million metric tons.
