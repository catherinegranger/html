<h2 class="region_subheader">

Part of the kingdom of Hungary since the 10th century, Slovakia became independent after the First World War. Until the country was hit by Phylloxera, there were vineyards throughout Slovakia, and Slovak wine was exported all over Europe.
Today, while the majority of Slovakian wine is sold domestically or to neighboring countries like Poland and Ukraine, a growing number of young producers are starting to export to international markets.

<h2 >Location &amp; Regions</h2>
<p>Slovakia is a landlocked Central European country sharing land borders with 5 countries: Poland in the north, Ukraine in the east, Hungary in the south, Austria in the south-west, and Czech Republic in the north-west. The central part of the country is covered with heavily-forested mountains while the Carpathian Mountains run along its northern borders with the Czech Republic and Poland. The south and the south-east are covered mostly by lowlands including the fertile Danube River plain.

Slovakia is divided into 6 wine-producing areas located in the southern part of the country: 
<ul class="bd_bullets">
<li>Malokarpatská vinohradnícka oblasť &mdash; "Little Carpathians Wine Region", in southwestern Slovakia, in the foothill of the Carpathian mountains near Bratislava
</li>
<li>Južnoslovenská vinohradnícka oblasť - "South Slovak Wine Region", just over the Danube River across from the Hungarian border.</li>
<li>Nitrianska vinohradnícka oblasť - "Nitra Wine Region", east of the Little Carpathians and north of the South Slovak Wine Region.</li>
<li>Stredoslovenská vinohradnícka oblasť - "Central Slovak Wine Region", east of the Nitra Wine Region along the Hungarian border.</li>
<li>Východoslovenská vinohradnícka oblasť - "East Slovak Wine Region" in southeastern Slovakia.</li>
<li>Vinohradnícka oblasť Tokaj - "Wine Region of Tokaj", the smallest wine region adjacent to the Hungarian Tokaj appellation.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2 >Grape Varietals</h2>
<p>Aside from the Tokaj grape varieties growing in Slovak Tokaj, Veltlínske zelené (Grüner Veltliner) is the most grown grape variety in western Slovakia. Another widely planted grape is Welschriesling, followed by Müller-Thurgau, Pinot blanc and Riesling.
Key red grape varieties include Frankovka modrá (Blaufränkisch), Svätovavrinecké (Saint Laurent) and more recently Cabernet Sauvignon growing in the warmer parts of the country.
