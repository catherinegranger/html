<span class="kalamfont pix14">&ldquo;I stumbled upon Blue Danube after my Croatia trip in 2015 and it has been the best wine buying and tasting experience for me, I spoke with Gisele and she introduced me to the Wine club. I only drink red wines so this has been a wonderful journey for me, to be able to taste various eastern European wines and Gisele is very thorough about explaining the regions and grapes of these wines and has always kept my specific palette in mind when recommending wines. I would recommend the Wine Club and Blue Danube to any wine enthusiast to connoisseur, with their selection, ease of receiving delivery and processing fees, it's an amazing find! Thank you!&rdquo;</span> Dimple K.

<span class="kalamfont pix14">&ldquo;I wanted to thank you for the good customer service and speedy delivery. Additionally, the Dingac Postup and Dingac Dingac are beloved by everyone that I give a sample to (and I am very stingy with how much I share). These two were delightful and so different than anyone else has tasted. My friend works at a winery in Napa and he brought the Dingac for the staff to taste. The crowd went wild and you will have at least 3 new customers shortly based on that bottle that I gifted to him.&rdquo;</span> Lawrence G.
